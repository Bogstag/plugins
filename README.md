# Plugins

This repository contains a curated collection of Codex plugin examples.

Each plugin lives under `plugins/<name>/` with a required
`.codex-plugin/plugin.json` manifest and optional companion surfaces such as
`skills/`, `.app.json`, `.mcp.json`, plugin-level `agents/`, `commands/`,
`hooks.json`, `assets/`, and other supporting files.

The default marketplace lives at `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and points
at the standard `plugins/` directory.
